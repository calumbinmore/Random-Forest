## Predicting Grid Demand using Random Forest

This Project is showing the steps necessary to build a random_forest
algorithm from scratch in Python. It starts by building a decision tree and 
adds stages until it functions as a random forest. 

This is done from the perspective of someone new to data science, so the 
issues and questions that I had, which are included in the project, will 
likely be similar to those that most beginners have.

In the future I hope to use it as part of a larger project.
